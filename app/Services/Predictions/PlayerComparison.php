/**
 * Builds the head-to-head "compare players" payload for the pool detail page: the viewer's own
 * results alongside up to a few selected opponents, so the page can render one lane per player.
 *
 * The load-bearing rule is the anti-cheat gate: another player's actual predictions (scorelines,
 * advancing picks, the projected table derived from them) are only ever exposed for a fixture whose
 * prediction window has {@see PredictionWindowStatus::Locked}. The viewer's own picks always show,
 * and points/standings (which exist only after results, i.e. always post-lock) are never gated.
 * A hidden prediction is omitted entirely from the payload — never serialised then blanked — so the
 * wire never carries a pick the viewer should not see. The frontend tells "hidden by lock" (window
 * not locked) from "no prediction" (window locked, key absent) using the {@see $windows} map.
