/**

 *
 * The rule is a single phase-window intersection: for every phase that is
 * {@see PredictionWindowStatus::Open} in BOTH the destination and the source pool, the source
 * user's picks for that phase overwrite the destination's. Group scorelines are universal (any
 * two pools of a tournament share the same fixtures), while knockout rounds only line up between
 * phased pools — an upfront pool's whole bracket is gated by the single group lock, so once the
 * tournament starts its knockout phases are never Open and fall out of the intersection on their
