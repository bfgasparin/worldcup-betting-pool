/**
 * Applies an approved batch of proposed scores, end to end and atomically: it writes each
 * (non-rejected) proposal onto its fixture and re-projects the official bracket from the new
 * results. The results are shared by every pool played over the tournament, so it then cascades
 * to each pool — recomputing its entries' points and snapshotting its leaderboard ranks so
 * movement arrows have a baseline. Running it again after a correction simply re-applies and
 * recomputes.
