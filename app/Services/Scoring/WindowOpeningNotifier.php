/**
 * After a result batch is approved, emails the players of a phased-bracket pool about every knockout
 * round whose prediction window just opened — a phase that was not {@see PredictionWindowStatus::Open}
 * before this approval and is now (its real participants have just been projected onto the fixtures).
 *
 * Idempotent by construction: the before/after diff is taken within a single approval, and a round's
 * Open → Locked transition is terminal, so re-approving a correction while a round is already open
 * re-sends nothing. No persistent "notified" flag is needed.
